Since the 1960s, this favorite place had been shut down, buried and also forgotten until it was discovered during work. The city of Wetzlar had the cascades repaired and restored. Since 2019, the water games have been running continuously during the day and are therefore open to visitors. Guided tours are also offered.",c,10,"2,5",10,15,No,"Museum, City Experience",History
